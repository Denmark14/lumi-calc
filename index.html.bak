Due to bugs, this tool has been shut down until I have the time to bring it up to the level of quality I expect for my work.
</br></br>
Current blockers until I get to this are:
<ul>
<li>Luminescent Site's map tool.</li>
<li>Luminescent 2.0.3</li>
<li>Christmas time.</li>
</ul>
I estimate a functional release somewhere around the second to third week of January 2024. 
</br></br>
If there are any other queries, you can find me in the <a href="https://discord.gg/luminescent">Luminescent Discord server</a>.
